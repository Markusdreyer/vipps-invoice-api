# Building JSON files

After updating the YAML files you can convert them to JSON by running the `yaml2json.py` script.
If you do not have the `pyyaml` dependency installed you can either do this with a package manager or
install it using `pip`.

```pip install -r requirements.txt # Will install all requirements```
