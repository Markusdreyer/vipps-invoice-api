# Vipps Invoice API

This is the API documentation for [**Vipps Regninger**]( https://www.vipps.no/bedrift/vipps-regninger).

*Please note that Vipps Regninger supersedes the older Vipps Faktura, both as a product and API.*

**Status:** ðŸ›  While we have worked closely with selected partners, and believe that this is
_very_ close to production quality, we are more than happy to receive feedback,
either with GitHub's built-in functionality for
[issue](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-invoice-api/issues),
[pull requests](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-invoice-api/pulls),
or contact us at integration@vipps.no.

Document version: 0.2.5.

## External documentation

### Technical details about the API

Swagger/OAS API documentation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-invoice-api

### Getting access to the Vipps Developer Portal

See
[the getting started guide](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api-getting-started.md)
for the Vipps eCommerce API for general information about the Vipps Developer Portal.
This is where you create keys to the API.

### Getting an access token

A valid access token is required in order to call this API. The API is provided by
a service called API Management in Azure. Think of it as the gateway to this API.
To get a token, follow [the guide for Vipps eCommerce API](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api.md)

This process can be confusing, so please read the guide. More details on how to use the
token is provided later in this documentation.

## Terminology

| Term |  Description                                    |
|:-----|:----------------------------------------------- |
| ISP         | The invoice _service_ providers, are all actors who submit invoices. Either for themselves or on behalf of their clients  |
| IPP         | The invoice _payment_ providers, are all actors who handle invoices for the invoice recipients and execute payments, e.g. banks, the Vipps app |
| NIN         | A national identification number, e.g. SSN in Norway ("fÃ¸dselsnummer", 11 digits).   |
| MSISDN      | A number uniquely identifying a subscription in a GSM or a UMTS mobile network. Simply put, it is the mapping of the telephone number to the SIM card in a mobile phone. See [MSISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSISDN). |
| Actor       | An ISP, IPP or invoicve recipient (_this description is incomplete_) |
| Idempotency |  The property of endpoints to be called multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. |

# Core functionality

## Send, receive and pay invoices

*Vipps Regninger* replaces the batch processing in *Vipps Faktura* with
a more speedy per-invoice processing, with improved status and progress for
each individual invoice. This means that invoices have to be posted one by one
in separate HTTP calls.

Although it may at first seem to be an inefficient approach, we believe that
the benefits far outweigh performance considerations. In addition, our
tests have shown that, if multiple threads are used to push invoices to our
system, the performance is well on par with a batch approach.

The main benefits are that it becomes much easier to ensure and verify
idempotency of the endpoint. We insert the received invoices _synchronously_. In
case of problems (such as `HTTP 5XX` return codes or network issues), it is possible to
simply repeatedly submit invoices until a `HTTP 2XX` status code is returned. We
guarantee that any invoice is inserted exactly once.

## Invoice validation

The validation of the invoice will still be an *asynchronous* process since we
have no possibility to guarantee, or even estimate, the response times for
all required validation and risk check to be performed.

Therefore, the invoice will be in a `pending` state once it is inserted.
In this state the invoice will not be visible to anyone. Only after all
validation steps are passed, will the invoice will be shown to the recipients.
ISPs who provide the invoice will have to monitor the state.

## Managing and paying invoices

IPPs will mainly use the `/invoices` resources directly. The typical use case
will be to fetch all invoices for a recipient (user), identified by a national
identification number. This is provided by
[`GET:/invoices`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/ipp.html#/IPP/List_Invoices_v1).

If a user approves an invoice, the payment provider has to mark this
individual invoice as processed so that the invoice is not displayed as an
open invoice in other services.

## Debt collection

All invoices contain information about the _invoice type_, i.e. whether it
is a regular invoice, reminder or other. This enables payment providers to
filter the allowed payment methods according to Norwegian debt collection laws.

# Invoice states

| # | State      | Description                                                                          |
|:--|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | `created`  | Invoice has been inserted, but not yet validated, and not yet shown to the recipient |
| 2 | `rejected` | Invoice could not be validated, and is rejected                                      |
| 3 | `pending`  | Invoice needs to be processed by the recipient                                       |
| 4 | `expired`  | Recipient did not process the invoice in time                                        |
| 5 | `approved` | Invoice has been approved by recipient                                               |
| 6 | `deleted`  | Invoice has been deleted                                                             |
| 7 | `revoked`  | Invoice has been revoked by the ISP                                                  |

# Authentication and authorization

Vipps has to ensure compliance with governing regulations, including
[GDPR](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en).
This means that we have to make sure that Vipps:

* Does not provide information about client, explicitly or implicitly, to unauthorised entities.
* Does not store information accidentally received, which we are not authorised to see.
* Propagate changes quickly if a user opts out or in to Vipps Regninger.
* Do not store personal information, i.e. invoices, which we do not have the right to see.
* Minimize the time we have any unauthorized data; i.e. we have to delete invoices we cannot resolve.

## API access token

The first thing that is required is to get the access token to the API. This is described
in the [external documentation section](#external-documentation).

Shortly summarized, you will have to make the following request
(`client_id`, `client_secret` and `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` placeholders must be replaced with real values):

```http
POST https://apitest.vipps.no/accesstoken/get
client_id: <client_id>
client_secret: <client_secret>
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key>
```
It _is_ correct that this is a `POST` request with an empty body.
This is due to some technical details of the backend solutions.

The request above will return a response similar to this:

```http
HTTP 200 OK
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": "86398",
  "ext_expires_in": "0",
  "expires_on": "1495271273",
  "not_before": "1495184574",
  "resource": "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000",
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1Ni <continued>"
}
```
Every request to the API, except the `/jwk` endpoint, needs to have an `Authorization` header with the generated token.
*(NOTE: The `/jwk` endpoint is not possible to use with the "Try out" feature in the Swagger documentation on GitHub).*

The header in the request to this API should look like this:

`Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1Ni <continued>`

## Recipient token

In addition to the general access token for the API, you need to create a
token for the recipient.

To submit an invoice to our system, the client first has to obtain a _recipient token_
with
[`POST://recipients/tokens`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/isp.html#/ISP/Request_Recipient_Token_v1).
This token can then be used
in the request body to
[`PUT:/invoices/{invoiceId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/isp.html#/ISP/Send_Invoice_v1).

Please note that this assumes that you have already authenticated with the
API token - which is not to be confused with the recipient token.

To ensure GDPR compliance, the token has a limited time to live, currently _15
minutes_. Until it's expiry, clients are free to cache the token and reuse it to
submit several invoices to the same recipient.

## Example 1: Send Invoice

| Step | Endpoint     | Description                   |
| -----| -------------| ----------------------------- |
| 1    | [`POST://recipients/tokens`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/isp.html#/ISP/Request_Recipient_Token_v1)    | The call will resolve the provided personal data and return a `recipientToken` if the recipient could be resolved. This token is used in the subsequent call. |
| 2    | [`PUT:/invoices/{invoiceId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/isp.html#/ISP/Send_Invoice_v1) | The previously obtained `recipientToken` is used in the request body to identify the recipient.  |

## Example 2: Fetch Invoices for Recipient

| Step | Endpoint     | Description                   |
| -----| -------------| ----------------------------- |
| 1    | [`POST:/recipients/tokens`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/isp.html#/ISP/Request_Recipient_Token_v1) | The call will resolve the provided personal data and return a `recipientToken` if the recipient could be resolved. This token is used in the subsequent call. |
| 2    | [`GET:/invoices`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/ipp.html#/IPP/List_Invoices_v1).   | The previously obtained `recipientToken` is used as a header to fetch all invoices for the recipient.                                                         |


## National identity number, or MSISDN, not available

Vipps requires either national identity number or MSISDN for
[`POST:/recipients/tokens`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/isp.html#/ISP/Request_Recipient_Token_v1).

# Retrieving invoice documents (attachments)

Invoice documents may be additional invoice documentation, such as
commercial invoices and attachments.

The IPP should retrieve the *actual* document download URL on demand on
behalf of its user. This is typically initiated when the user clicks on a
download link in a UI. The user's request should first be made to a backend
system that in turn makes the authenticated request to this API to retrieve
the *time-limited* URL to the actual document.

The URL contains a JWT query parameter that is validated by the ISP.
The expiry time (`EXP`) is inside the JWT.

Each invoice document has one or more MIME types. This means that
[`GET:/invoices/{invoiceId}/attachments/{attachmentId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/ipp.html#/IPP/Get_Attachment_For_Invoice_v1)
must include the `mimeType` query parameter that specifies the mime type to
retrieve, i.e. document file type. The MIME type is available to the IPP when
listing all the documents. This allows the IPP to present it in multiple ways.

PDF is a commonly used MIME type, which can be displayed in most contexts.

There is currently no limitation to the length of the URL.

## Typical flow

1. An invoice is sent with [`PUT:/invoices/{invoiceId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/isp.html#/ISP/Send_Invoice_v1),
containing the "commercial invoice" attachment, with an URL like `https://invoice-hotel.example.org/123456-abcdef-7890.pdf`
The URL sent by the ISP when creating an invoice should be valid as long as possible (more than 12 months is good).
The validity will be controlled with the JWT appended.

2. Sometime later, the end user clicks on "show invoice" in the app. The
[`GET:/invoices/{invoiceid}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/ipp.html#/IPP/Get_Single_Invoice_v1)
request returns a response with the URL and a JWT appended.
The returned URL would be something like `https://invoice-hotel.example.org/123456-abcdef-7890.pdf?token=[jwt_token_goes_here]`.

3. The app/online bank will redirect the user to the document. Most likely the user
will have a browser opened that loads the document.

4. The IPP/invoice hotel will receive the request directly from the end user's device,
and will need to validate the JWT token before sending the document data.

5. If the JWT is valid, the user is sent the document data (e.g. the PDF).


## Validating the JWT and the request

The IPP/invoice hotel is responsible for validating the JWT
before returning the document.

The JWT contains the following relevant claims:

* `ISS` (issuer): Who is issuing the JWT. Typically `vipps-invoice-api`.
* `AUD` (audience): Something identifying the IPP.
* `SUB` (subject): The base URL for the document.
* `EXP` (expiration): A specific moment in time where the JWT becomes invalid.
* `ALG` (algorithm): Encryption algorithm. Vipps will use **RS256**.

The API's public key is required in order to validate the request. The public
key is available as JSON Web Key (JWK) under the
[`GET:/jwk`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/ipp.html#/IPP/get_jwk)
endpoint.

Please note that the `/jwk` endpoint does not require authentication.

It is **highly** recommended to use a pre-made library.
The library should at least help with validating the expiry time.

In addition to validating the JWT's authenticity and basic properties,
the IPP/invoice hotel must ensure to validate the following:

* The expired timestamp is in the future. i.e. not expired.

* Make sure that the URL is valid. One approach is to return the `SUB` and
ignore the actual path.

For details on JWT, use the [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) or
[jwt.io](https://www.jwt.io). The latter contains a list of pre-made
libraries.

## Detailed state descriptions

### State 1: Created

The start state of an invoice is `created`. Invoices received are directly
inserted into the database with only minimal validation performed on the provided
request body.

This way, the ingestion is decoupled from the actual validation and can keep the
workload on the ingesting endpoints low, so that we can achieve fast response
times.

The actual validation will potentially include many calls to external services
where, and response times can not be guaranteed.
This asynchronous approach is required.

#### Transitions

**Transitions 1, 2: `created` -> `pending`, `rejected`**

The state transition from the initial state `created` is performed internally.
Once an invoice is inserted, it will be picked up by a worker
which validates the invoice and updates the status to either `rejected` or
`pending` depending on the validation result.

**Transition 3: `created` -> `revoke**

An ISP can revoke an invoice by calling
[`PUT:/invoices/{id}/status/{revoked}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/isp.html#/ISP/Revoke_Invoice_v1)
It _could_ have been a `DELETE`, but we decided to use `PUT` verbs consistently.

### State 2: Rejected

If the validation has failed, the invoice ends up in the `rejected` state. This is
an end state, and means that the invoice was not accepted into our system and is
never shown to any recipient. This is a final state and does not allow any further state transitions.

### State 3: Pending

The invoice validated successfully and is now delivered to recipients when
IPPs fetch invoices for a recipient.

#### Transitions

**Transition 4: `pending` -> `expired`**
Without any user action, the invoice will become `expired` after the _due date_

plus a grace period of 14 days. An expired invoice _must not be paid_.

**Transition 5: `pending` -> `deleted`**

A recipient can choose to delete an invoice. This is done by calling
[`PUT:/invoice/{id}/deleted`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/ipp.html#/IPP/Delete_Invoice_v1).
As described above there is a potential ambiguity to distinguish this call from
the endpoint to _revoke_ an invoice. As described above, we use `PUT` verbs
consistently.

**Transition 6: `pending` -> `approved`**

If a recipient pays an invoice, the IPP should call
[`PUT:/invoices/{id}/status/approved`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/ipp.html#/IPP/Change_Status_To_Approved_v1)
to mark the invoice as `approved.` It accepts two fields, `due` and `amount` as
payload in the request body.

These two fields indicate when the payment is scheduled and the amount of the
scheduled payment. The amount must be within the valid amount specified in the
invoice.

If no further actions are taken, this is the final state of the invoice.

**Transition 7: `pending` -> `revoked`**

As long as the invoice is `pending`, an ISP can still revoke an invoice by calling
[`PUT:/invoices/{id}/status/revoked`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/isp.html#/ISP/Revoke_Invoice_v1)
The invoice will then disappear from the recipient's list of pending invoices.

## State 4: Expired

If a pending invoice is not processed by the recipient, it will be set to `expired`
after the due date plus the grace period of 14 days has passed.

This is a final state and does not allow any further state transitions.

## State 5: Approved

An `approved` invoice means that the recipient has actively approved the invoice
by scheduling a payment through an IPP. The payment has to be scheduled within
the allowed time, latest at the due date and the scheduled amount has to be within
the allowed range defined in the invoice.

### Transitions

All transitions from the state `approved` can only be initiated by the same IPP
that set the status to `approved`. This limitation is required.

**Transition 8: `approved` -> `approved`**

If the IPP allows for changing the payment details of an approved invoice,
the status can be updated by calling
[`PUT:/invoice/{id}/status/approved`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/ipp.html#/IPP/Change_Status_To_Approved_v1)
again with the updated payment details.

**Transition 9: `approved` -> `pending`**

The user may want to change an `approved` invoice back to `pending`.
_This transition is not yet fully specified._

**Transition 10: `approved` -> `deleted`**

A user may directly delete an already approved invoice if the IPP allows
changing the payment. This is done by calling
[`PUT:/invoices/{id}/status/deleted`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-invoice-api/ipp.html#/IPP/Delete_Invoice_v1).
Deleting an invoice from this state means that the linked payment was _not_
executed and/or is stopped. It is the IPPs responsibility to ensure that.

## State 6: Deleted

The invoice has been deleted by the recipient. A `deleted` invoice can still be
shown to a recipient once queries to display old/historical invoices are supported.

This is a final state and does not allow any further state transitions.

## State 7: Revoked

The invoice has been revoked by the issuer. A `revoked` invoice becomes invisible
for the recipient.

This is a final state and does not allow any further state transitions.
