  title: Vipps Invoice API
  description: >-
    # Welcome

    This is the API for Vipps Regninger. While we have worked closely with
    selected partners, and believe that this is very close to production
    quality, we are more than happy to receive feedback, either with GitHub's
    issue functionality, or by email.

    ## ISP and IPP?

    Throughout this specification we use the terms ISP and IPP to categorize two
    groups of users.

    * ISP, the invoice service providers, are all actors who submit invoices.
      Either for themselves or on behalf of their clients.
    * IPP, the invoice payment providers, are all actors who handle invoices
      for the invoice recipients and execute payments, e.g. banks, the vipps
      app.

    # Core Functionality

    ## Send, receive and pay invoices.

    Since version 0.1.8, we have changed the workflow. Previously, we followed
    the classical approach of working with batches. However, we wanted to
    simplify the workflow and be more explicit and have changed that approach in
    favour of a simple \"submit a single invoice\" approach. This means that
    invoices have to be posted one by one, each invoice in a separate http call.

    Although it might seem to be an \"inefficient\" approach, we believe that
    the benefits far outweight performance considerations. In addition, our
    tests have shown that the performance is well on par with a batch approach,
    if multiple threads are used to push invoices to our system.

    The main benefits are that it becomes much easier to ensure and verify
    idempotency of the endpoint. We insert received invoices _synchronously_. In
    case of problems (5xx return codes or network issues), it is possible to
    just repeatedly submit invoices until a 2xx status code is returned. We
    guarantee that any invoice is exactly inserted once.

    The validation of the invoice will still be an asynchronous process since we
    have no possibibility to guarantee or even estimate the response times for
    all required validation and risk checks we have to perform.

    Therefore, the invoice will be in a \"pending\" state once it is inserted.
    In this state the invoice will not be visible to anyone. First, when all
    validation steps are passed, the invoice will be shown to the recipients.

    ISPs who provide the invoice will have to monitor the state. We provide two
    ways to do that.

    ## Managing/Paying Invoices

    Invoice payment providers will mainly require to work with the resource
    `invoices` directly. The typical use case will be to fetch all invoices for
    a use/recipient, identified by his national identification number. This is
    provided by `GET: /invoices`.

    If a user approves an invoice, the payment provider has to mark this
    individual invoice as processed so that the invoice is not displayed as an
    open invoice in other services.

    ## Debt Collection

    All invoices contain information about the _invoice type_, i.e. whether it
    is a regular invoice, reminder or other. This enables payment providers to
    filter the allowed payment methods according to Norwegian inkasso rules.

    # Invoice states

    | Name | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | created | Invoice has been inserted, but not yet validated, and not yet shown to the recipient |
    | rejected | Invoice could not be validated, and is rejected |
    | pending | Invoice needs to be processed by the recipient |
    | expired | Recipient did not process the invoice in time |
    | approved | Invoice has been approved by recipient |
    | deleted | Invoice has been deleted |
    | revoked | Invoice has been revoked by the ISP |

    See the `PUT:/invoices/{invoiceId}/status/*state*` methods for details about changing the `state`.

    ## Retrieving invoice documents (i.e. commercial invoice and attachments)

    The IPP should retrieve the *actual* document download URL on demand on
    behalf of its user. This is typically initiated when the user clicks on a
    download link in a UI. The user's request should first be made to a back-end
    system that in turn makes the authenticated request to this API to retrieve
    the *time-limited* URL to the actual document. The URL contains a *JWT*
    query parameter that is validated by the ISP. The expiry time (i.e. TTL) is
    inside the JWT.

    Each invoice document has one or more mime types. This means that `GET
    /invoices/{invoiceId}/attachments/{attachmentId}` must include the
    `mimeType` query parameter that specifies the mime type to retrieve, i.e.
    document file type. The mime type is available to the IPP when listing all
    the documents, so it is not necessary to guess.

    ## Validating the JWT and the request

    The IPP is responsible for validating the JWT. The JWT contains the
    following relevant claims:

    * `ISS` (issuer): Who is issuing the JWT. Typically `vipps-invoice-api`.

    * `AUD` (audience): Something identifying the IPP.

    * `SUB` (subject): The base URL for the document.

    * `EXP` (expiration): A specific moment in time where the JWT becomes
    invalid.

    * `ALG` (algorithm): Encryption algorithm. Vipps will use **RS256**.


    The APIs public key is required in order to validate the request. The public
    key is available as JSON Web Key (JWK) under the `/jwk` endpoint. It is
    suggested to Use a JWK library to parse and use the key.


    In addition to validating the JWT, the IPP/invoice hotel must ensure to
    validate the following:

    * The expired timestamp is in the future. I.e. not expired.

    * Make sure that the URL is valid. One approach is to return the `SUB` and
    ignore the actual path.


    For details on JWT, use the [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) or
    [jwt.io](https://www.jwt.io). The latter contains a list of pre-made
    libraries. We **highly** recommend using a pre-made library. It should at
    least validate the expiry time.

    # Changelog

    ## 0.2.24

    * * Corrected documentation of `state` for invoices, and some minor text tweaks.

    ## 0.2.23

    * Improved documentation for Ã¬nvoiceId`.

    ## 0.2.22

    * fix: the token returned from `GET:/recipients/tokens` is now returned
      as a proper json document with the field `recipientToken`
    * extended the datamodel for errors. Error returned by the API will now
      include the required fields `type` and `title` plus the optional fields
      `detail` and `instance`. The content of the field is according to
      [RFC7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807)
